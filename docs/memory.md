# Autonomous Memory

When enabled, the agent automatically extracts durable knowledge from past sessions and injects a compact summary into each new session. Over time it builds a project-scoped memory store — technical decisions, recurring workflows, pitfalls — that carries forward without manual effort.

Disabled by default. Enable via `/settings` or `config.yml`:

```yaml
memories:
  enabled: true
```

## Usage

### What gets injected

At session start, if a memory summary exists for the current project, it is injected into the system prompt as a **Memory Guidance** block. The agent is instructed to:

- Treat memory as heuristic context — useful for process and prior decisions, not authoritative on current repo state.
- Cite the memory artifact path when memory changes the plan, and pair it with current-repo evidence before acting.
- Prefer repo state and user instruction when they conflict with memory; treat conflicting memory as stale.

### Reading memory artifacts

The agent can read memory files directly using `memory://` URLs with the `read` tool:

| URL | Content |
|---|---|
| `memory://root` | Compact summary injected at startup |
| `memory://root/MEMORY.md` | Full long-term memory document |
| `memory://root/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | A generated skill playbook |

### `/memory` slash command

| Subcommand | Effect |
|---|---|
| `view` | Show the current memory injection payload |
| `clear` / `reset` | Delete all memory data and generated artifacts |
| `enqueue` / `rebuild` | Force consolidation to run at next startup |

## How it works

Memories are built by a background pipeline that at startup or manually triggered via slash command.

**Phase 1 — per-session extraction:** For each past session that has changed since it was last processed, a model reads the session history and extracts durable signal: technical decisions, constraints, resolved failures, recurring workflows. Sessions that are too recent, too old, or currently active are skipped. Each extraction produces a raw memory block and a short synopsis for that session.

**Phase 2 — consolidation:** After extraction, a second model pass reads all per-session extractions and produces three outputs written to disk:

- `MEMORY.md` — a curated long-term memory document
- `memory_summary.md` — the compact text injected at session start
- `skills/` — reusable procedural playbooks, each in its own subdirectory

Phase 2 uses a lease to prevent double-running when multiple processes start simultaneously. Stale skill directories from prior runs are pruned automatically.

All output is scanned for secrets before being written to disk.

### Extraction behavior

Memory extraction and consolidation behavior is driven entirely by static prompt files in `src/prompts/memories/`.

| File | Purpose | Variables |
|---|---|---|
| `stage_one_system.md` | System prompt for per-session extraction | — |
| `stage_one_input.md` | User-turn template wrapping session content | `{{thread_id}}`, `{{response_items_json}}` |
| `consolidation.md` | Prompt for cross-session consolidation | `{{raw_memories}}`, `{{rollout_summaries}}` |
| `read_path.md` | Memory guidance injected into live sessions | `{{memory_summary}}` |

### Model selection

Memory piggybacks on the model role system.

| Phase | Role | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 1 (extraction) | `default` | Per-session knowledge extraction |
| Phase 2 (consolidation) | `smol` | Cross-session synthesis |

If `smol` is not configured, Phase 2 falls back to the `default` role.

## Configuration

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `memories.enabled` | `false` | Master switch |
| `memories.maxRolloutAgeDays` | `30` | Sessions older than this are not processed |
| `memories.minRolloutIdleHours` | `12` | Sessions active more recently than this are skipped |
| `memories.maxRolloutsPerStartup` | `64` | Cap on sessions processed in a single startup |
| `memories.summaryInjectionTokenLimit` | `5000` | Max tokens of the summary injected into the system prompt |

Additional tuning knobs (concurrency, lease durations, token budgets) are available in config for advanced use.
