# Bash tool runtime

This document describes the **`bash` tool** runtime path used by agent tool calls, from command normalization to execution, truncation/artifacts, and rendering.

It also calls out where behavior diverges in interactive TUI, print mode, RPC mode, and user-initiated bang (`!`) shell execution.

## Scope and runtime surfaces

There are two different bash execution surfaces in coding-agent:

1. **Tool-call surface** (`toolName: "bash"`): used when the model calls the bash tool.
   - Entry point: `BashTool.execute()`.
2. **User bang-command surface** (`!cmd` from interactive input or RPC `bash` command): session-level helper path.
   - Entry point: `AgentSession.executeBash()`.

Both eventually use `executeBash()` in `src/exec/bash-executor.ts` for non-PTY execution, but only the tool-call path runs normalization/interception and tool renderer logic.

## End-to-end tool-call pipeline

## 1) Input normalization and parameter merge

`BashTool.execute()` first normalizes the raw command via `normalizeBashCommand()`:

- extracts trailing `| head -n N`, `| head -N`, `| tail -n N`, `| tail -N` into structured limits,
- trims trailing/leading whitespace,
- keeps internal whitespace intact.

Then it merges extracted limits with explicit tool args:

- explicit `head`/`tail` args override extracted values,
- extracted values are fallback only.

### Caveat

`bash-normalize.ts` comments mention stripping `2>&1`, but current implementation does not remove it. Runtime behavior is still correct (stdout/stderr are already merged), but the normalization behavior is narrower than comments suggest.

## 2) Optional interception (blocked-command path)

If `bashInterceptor.enabled` is true, `BashTool` loads rules from settings and runs `checkBashInterception()` against the normalized command.

Interception behavior:

- command is blocked **only** when:
  - regex rule matches, and
  - the suggested tool is present in `ctx.toolNames`.
- invalid regex rules are silently skipped.
- on block, `BashTool` throws `ToolError` with message:
  - `Blocked: ...`
  - original command included.

Default rule patterns (defined in code) target common misuses:

- file readers (`cat`, `head`, `tail`, ...)
- search tools (`grep`, `rg`, ...)
- file finders (`find`, `fd`, ...)
- in-place editors (`sed -i`, `perl -i`, `awk -i inplace`)
- shell redirection writes (`echo ... > file`, heredoc redirection)

### Caveat

`InterceptionResult` includes `suggestedTool`, but `BashTool` currently surfaces only the message text (no structured suggested-tool field in `details`).

## 3) CWD validation and timeout clamping

`cwd` is resolved relative to session cwd (`resolveToCwd`), then validated via `stat`:

- missing path -> `ToolError("Working directory does not exist: ...")`
- non-directory -> `ToolError("Working directory is not a directory: ...")`

Timeout is clamped to `[1, 3600]` seconds and converted to milliseconds.

## 4) Artifact allocation

Before execution, the tool allocates an artifact path/id (best-effort) for truncated output storage.

- artifact allocation failure is non-fatal (execution continues without artifact spill file),
- artifact id/path are passed into execution path for full-output persistence on truncation.

## 5) PTY vs non-PTY execution selection

`BashTool` chooses PTY execution only when all are true:

- `bash.virtualTerminal === "on"`
- `PI_NO_PTY !== "1"`
- tool context has UI (`ctx.hasUI === true` and `ctx.ui` set)

Otherwise it uses non-interactive `executeBash()`.

That means print mode and non-UI RPC/tool contexts always use non-PTY.

## Non-interactive execution engine (`executeBash`)

## Shell session reuse model

`executeBash()` caches native `Shell` instances in a process-global map keyed by:

- shell path,
- configured command prefix,
- snapshot path,
- serialized shell env,
- optional agent session key.

For session-level executions, `AgentSession.executeBash()` passes `sessionKey: this.sessionId`, isolating reuse per session.

Tool-call path does **not** pass `sessionKey`, so reuse scope is based on shell config/snapshot/env.

## Shell config and snapshot behavior

At each call, executor loads settings shell config (`shell`, `env`, optional `prefix`).

If selected shell includes `bash`, it attempts `getOrCreateSnapshot()`:

- snapshot captures aliases/functions/options from user rc,
- snapshot creation is best-effort,
- failure falls back to no snapshot.

If `prefix` is configured, command becomes:

```text
<prefix> <command>
```

## Streaming and cancellation

`Shell.run()` streams chunks to callback. Executor pipes each chunk into `OutputSink` and optional `onChunk` callback.

Cancellation:

- aborted signal triggers `shellSession.abort(...)`,
- timeout from native result is mapped to `cancelled: true` + annotation text,
- explicit cancellation similarly returns `cancelled: true` + annotation.

No exception is thrown inside executor for timeout/cancel; it returns structured `BashResult` and lets caller map error semantics.

## Interactive PTY path (`runInteractiveBashPty`)

When PTY is enabled, tool runs `runInteractiveBashPty()` which opens an overlay console component and drives a native `PtySession`.

Behavior highlights:

- xterm-headless virtual terminal renders viewport in overlay,
- keyboard input is normalized (including Kitty sequences and application cursor mode handling),
- `esc` while running kills the PTY session,
- terminal resize propagates to PTY (`session.resize(cols, rows)`).

Environment hardening defaults are injected for unattended runs:

- pagers disabled (`PAGER=cat`, `GIT_PAGER=cat`, etc.),
- editor prompts disabled (`GIT_EDITOR=true`, `EDITOR=true`, ...),
- terminal/auth prompts reduced (`GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0`, `SSH_ASKPASS=/usr/bin/false`, `CI=1`),
- package-manager/tool automation flags for non-interactive behavior.

PTY output is normalized (`CRLF`/`CR` to `LF`, `sanitizeText`) and written into `OutputSink`, including artifact spill support.

On PTY startup/runtime error, sink receives `PTY error: ...` line and command finalizes with undefined exit code.

## Output handling: streaming, truncation, artifact spill

Both PTY and non-PTY paths use `OutputSink`.

## OutputSink semantics

- keeps an in-memory UTF-8-safe tail buffer (`DEFAULT_MAX_BYTES`, currently 50KB),
- tracks total bytes/lines seen,
- if artifact path exists and output overflows (or file already active), writes full stream to artifact file,
- when memory threshold overflows, trims in-memory buffer to tail (UTF-8 boundary safe),
- marks `truncated` when overflow/file spill occurs.

`dump()` returns:

- `output` (possibly annotated prefix),
- `truncated`,
- `totalLines/totalBytes`,
- `outputLines/outputBytes`,
- `artifactId` if artifact file was active.

### Long-output caveat

Runtime truncation is byte-threshold based in `OutputSink` (50KB default). It does not enforce a hard 2000-line cap in this code path.

## Live tool updates

For non-PTY execution, `BashTool` uses a separate `TailBuffer` for partial updates and emits `onUpdate` snapshots while command is running.

For PTY execution, live rendering is handled by custom UI overlay, not by `onUpdate` text chunks.

## Result shaping, metadata, and error mapping

After execution:

1. `cancelled` handling:
   - if abort signal is aborted -> throw `ToolAbortError` (abort semantics),
   - else -> throw `ToolError` (treated as tool failure).
2. PTY `timedOut` -> throw `ToolError`.
3. apply head/tail filters to final output text (`applyHeadTail`, head then tail).
4. empty output becomes `(no output)`.
5. attach truncation metadata via `toolResult(...).truncationFromSummary(result, { direction: "tail" })`.
6. exit-code mapping:
   - missing exit code -> `ToolError("... missing exit status")`
   - non-zero exit -> `ToolError("... Command exited with code N")`
   - zero exit -> success result.

Success payload structure:

- `content`: text output,
- `details.meta.truncation` when truncated, including:
  - `direction`, `truncatedBy`, total/output line+byte counts,
  - `shownRange`,
  - `artifactId` when available.

Because built-in tools are wrapped with `wrapToolWithMetaNotice()`, truncation notice text is appended to final text content automatically (for example: `Full: artifact://<id>`).

## Rendering paths

## Tool-call renderer (`bashToolRenderer`)

`bashToolRenderer` is used for tool-call messages (`toolCall` / `toolResult`):

- collapsed mode shows visual-line-truncated preview,
- expanded mode shows all currently available output text,
- warning line includes truncation reason and `artifact://<id>` when truncated,
- timeout value (from args) is shown in footer metadata line.

### Caveat: full artifact expansion

`BashRenderContext` has `isFullOutput`, but current renderer context builder does not set it for bash tool results. Expanded view still uses the text already in result content (tail/truncated output) unless another caller provides full artifact content.

## User bang-command component (`BashExecutionComponent`)

`BashExecutionComponent` is for user `!` commands in interactive mode (not model tool calls):

- streams chunks live,
- collapsed preview keeps last 20 logical lines,
- line clamp at 4000 chars per line,
- shows truncation + artifact warnings when metadata is present,
- marks cancelled/error/exit state separately.

This component is wired by `CommandController.handleBashCommand()` and fed from `AgentSession.executeBash()`.

## Operational caveats

- Interceptor only blocks commands when suggested tool is currently available in context.
- If artifact allocation fails, truncation still occurs but no `artifact://` back-reference is available.
- Shell session cache has no explicit eviction in this module; lifetime is process-scoped.
- PTY and non-PTY timeout surfaces differ:
  - PTY exposes explicit `timedOut` result field,
  - non-PTY maps timeout into `cancelled + annotation` summary.
