# Gemini Image

Generate or edit images using Gemini image models.

<instruction>
You SHOULD provide structured parameters for best results. Tool assembles into optimized prompt.

When using multiple `input_images`, you MUST describe each image's role in `subject` or `scene` field:
- "Use Image 1 for the character's face and outfit, Image 2 for the pose, Image 3 for the background environment"
- "Match the color palette from Image 1, apply the lighting style from Image 2"
</instruction>

<output>
Returns generated image saved to disk. Response includes file path where image was written.
</output>

<caution>
- For photoreal: you SHOULD add "ultra-detailed, realistic, natural skin texture" to style
- For posters/cards: you SHOULD use 9:16 aspect ratio with negative space for text placement
- For iteration: you SHOULD use `changes` for targeted adjustments rather than regenerating from scratch
- For text: you SHOULD add "sharp, legible, correctly spelled" for important text; keep text short
- For diagrams: you SHOULD include "scientifically accurate" in style and provide facts explicitly
</caution>
