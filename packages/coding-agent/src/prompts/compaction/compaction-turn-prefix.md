This is the PREFIX of a turn that was too large to keep. The SUFFIX (recent work) is retained.

You **MUST** summarize the prefix to provide context for the retained suffix:

## Original Request

[What did the user ask for in this turn?]

## Early Progress
- [Key decisions and work done in the prefix]

## Context for Suffix
- [Information needed to understand the retained recent work]

You **MUST** output only the structured summary. You **MUST NOT** include extra text.

You **MUST** be concise. You **MUST** preserve exact file paths, function names, error messages, and relevant tool outputs or command results if they appear. You **MUST** focus on what's needed to understand the kept suffix.
