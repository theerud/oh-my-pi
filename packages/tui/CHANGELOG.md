# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [12.18.0] - 2026-02-21
### Fixed

- Fixed viewport synchronization issue by clearing scrollback when terminal state becomes desynced during full re-renders

## [12.12.2] - 2026-02-19

### Fixed

- Fixed non-forced full re-renders clearing terminal scrollback history during streaming updates by limiting scrollback clears to explicit forced re-renders.

## [12.12.0] - 2026-02-19

### Added

- Added PageUp/PageDown navigation for editor content and autocomplete selection to jump across long wrapped inputs faster.

### Fixed

- Fixed history-entry navigation anchoring (Up opens at top, Down opens at bottom) and preserved editor scroll context when max-height changes to keep cursor movement visible in long prompts ([#99](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/99)).

## [12.11.3] - 2026-02-19

### Fixed

- Fixed differential deleted-line rendering when content shrinks to empty so stale first-row content is cleared reliably.
