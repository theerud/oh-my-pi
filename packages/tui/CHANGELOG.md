# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Auto-space before pasted file paths**: When pasting a file path (starting with `/`, `~`, or `.`) and the cursor is after a word character, a space is automatically prepended for better readability. Useful when dragging screenshots from macOS. ([#307](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/307) by [@mitsuhiko](https://github.com/mitsuhiko))
- **Word navigation for Input component**: Added Ctrl+Left/Right and Alt+Left/Right support for word-by-word cursor movement. ([#306](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/306) by [@kim0](https://github.com/kim0))
- **Full Unicode input**: Input component now accepts Unicode characters beyond ASCII. ([#306](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/306) by [@kim0](https://github.com/kim0))

### Fixed

- **Readline-style Ctrl+W**: Now skips trailing whitespace before deleting the preceding word, matching standard readline behavior. ([#306](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/306) by [@kim0](https://github.com/kim0))
